## next steps
- set up git repo ✓
- familiarise with git commits/merges ✓
- look at the data files 
  - decide how best to merge/analyse the data
  - work out how to import into R and merge

## thoughts
why do this:
- targetting vulnerable populations of disease
- finding populations that respond poorly to vaccinations
- optimising the cost (money / logistical) of 

## statistical approaches
- traditional:
  - univariate
  - multivariate
  - LASSO etc..
- modern:
  - kmeans
  - pca 
  - louvain / phenograph
  - tsne/umaps
  - neural network stuff
  - random forest

## challenges of this challenge
- missing data
- types of data
- data standardisation

## challenges of this in general
- disparate data systems
- covid:
  - shielding/vulnerable

## questions we need to answer
- 1. working with biostatisticians:
  - importance of statistical methods
  - valid statistics
  - multiple testing
  - validation / training
- 2. new diseases/vaccines:
